User Graphics Directory - Any picture copied
in here with the same name as the picture
package or /cache will be loaded in first.
The checksum will not be tested.

This allows users to customize the server
graphics the client shows.

To reload the old pictures, delete the
pictures from this directory you don't want
to show anymore and restart the client.
